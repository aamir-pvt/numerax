In a mutual fund, fees are charges levied on investors to cover operational and management expenses. These fees can include management fees, administrative fees, and other costs. The position of fees in a mutual fund refers to their ranking in priority, with some fees taking precedence over others. For example, management fees may be the highest priority, followed by administrative fees, and then other costs. Understanding the fees associated with a mutual fund is important for investors to make informed investment decisions.
